# TimeUniv&ChronoSimple
The project is about two classes, the ChronoSimple class which offer time computation in different unit nano, ms, s. So it can be used for high precision computation.
It use the std::chrono and high_resolution_clock. In it's body. simple to use. And the UnivTime class. which is a class that will perform, reformating the elapsed time from one of the unit (nano, ms, s) to a readable format. Adding new format is just easy. The project is just a simple demonstration of an implemenation of a high precision nano chrono. Whith ease of use. To know how things work just go and see the demo.cpp and demo.exe. Also look at the source code of course. 
NOTE: to succesfuly compile this project you need to have a gcc compiler that have a posix thread model. So make sure to have such a compiler (linux and mac user will have no problem, gcc default compiler is a posix thread model.). the problem is windows users. you need to download MinGW-w64-posix suite, here a link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/External%20binary%20packages%20%28Win64%20hosted%29/pthreads/
peak the right one posix. Then the bin folder of the suite (which contain gcc, g++, ....) to the path system environment variale. Make sure to add it at the start. so that you make sure it's the version to be run (if you don't understand, search about those wordkeys). You can test the version by gcc -v. Make sure it's the right version, thread model: posix.
